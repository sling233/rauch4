# Wokkagames

Minecraft Datapack PvP Game with abilities, different classes and gamemodes, meant to play with friends.

To use, go to the latest release and download wokkagames.zip into .minecraft/saves/<Your_World>/datapacks. No need to extract.

In Minecraft, go to your world and type `/reload`. From here an in-game guide is available.

To play the game properly you also need the Resource Pack, you can get it [here](https://github.com/flaviusmus/wokkagames_texturepack).
