# Wokkagames

Wokkagames (don't ask about the name) is a Minecraft data pack PvP game. It consists of multiple game modes, that are all played with up to 12 players divided into 2 competing teams. Each player can choose from one of several kits with unique stats and abilities. A prebuilt lobby  and several maps are available but you can easily add your own if you want. At least 2 players per team are recommended.

## Installation
- Go to the [latest release] and download wokkagames.zip. No need to extract.
- The release page also links to a resource pack - install it (instructions available there).
- Use the exact Minecraft version specified in the release (latest version uses 1.21.11)
- Create a new creative world, preferrably a completely empty one (eg. by creating a superflat World and using the "The Void" preset).
- Move wokkagames.zip into `.../.minecraft/saves/<Your_World>/datapacks/`.
- Either exit and re-enter the world or type `/reload`
- The pack will guide you through the rest of the steps from here (make sure to read the admin guide, it has a tl;dr)
