# Rauchergames

Minecraft Datapack Game with abilities and stuff, meant to play with friends (i spent way too much time programming this).

To use, go to the latest release and download rauch4.zip into .minecraft/saves/<Your_World>/datapacks. No need to extract.

In Minecraft, go to your world and type `/reload`. From here an in-game guide is available.

To play the game properly you also need the Resource Pack, you can get it [here](https://github.com/flaviusmus/rauch_texturepack).
