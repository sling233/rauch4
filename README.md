# Rauchergames

Very epic Minecraft Datapack game i spent way too much time on. But it's very epic.

When downloading make sure you place the folder "rauch4" into .minecraft/saves/<Your_World>/datapacks/ (in rauch4, there should be a file called "pack.mcmeta", not another folder "rauch4". might not be a prolem but idk how github manages zipping and stuff)

If you want to edit game settings etc. do `/tag <player> add admin`. You can do this for everyone you want.  
To withdraw these rights do `/tag <player> remove admin`.

To play the game properly you also need the texture pack, you can get it [here](https://github.com/flaviusmus/rauch_texturepack).
