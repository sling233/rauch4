# Rauchergames

Very epic Minecraft Datapack game i spent way too much time on. But it's very epic.

To use, go to the latest release and download rauch4.zip into .minecraft/saves/<Your_World>/datapacks. No need to extract.

In Minecraft, go to your world and type `/reload`. From here an in-game guide is available.

To play the game properly you also need the resource pack, you can get it [here](https://github.com/flaviusmus/rauch_texturepack).
