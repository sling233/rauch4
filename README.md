# rauch4

Very epic Minecraft Datapack game i spent way too much time on. But it's very epic.

When downloading make sure you place the folder "rauch4" into .minecraft/saves/<Your_World>/datapacks/ (in rauch4, there should be a file called "pack.mcmeta", not another folder "rauch4". might not be a prolem but idk how github manages zipping and stuff)
